# Travelling-waves-or-sequentially-activated-discrete-modules

Repository for analyzing simulated or recorded electrophisiological data.

## General description
This code was used to analyze data for the paper ...
There are two main section - SimulationAnalysis which analyzed simualted 
data created by BrainStorm, and WaveAnalysis which is used (mainly) to
analyze the electrophysiological recordings.

To understand how the code was used, see the scripts in analysis_scripts, 
which show how the data for the main figures were created.

To actually run a particular script please contact Mark for the relevant 
datas.

## Dependencies
Data analysis of recorded electrophysiological uses NET code for data processing.
Please clone it and have add it to path.
